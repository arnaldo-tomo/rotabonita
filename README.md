# Rotabonita

> Install the package. That's it. Your Laravel routes go from `/posts/1` to `/posts/BYPWtH2qYos` — automatically, with zero configuration, zero traits, zero model changes.

**Rotabonita** is a Laravel 10/11 package that automatically replaces numeric database IDs in your URLs with short, secure, URL-safe public tokens — the same 11-character format YouTube uses for video URLs (e.g. `BYPWtH2qYos`).

It works dynamically in memory:
- **Zero Database Columns** — Does not require adding a `public_id` column to your database.
- **Zero Migrations** — No artisan commands or schema publishing needed.
- **URL generation** — `route('posts.show', $post)` dynamically encodes `/1` into `/BYPWtH2qYos`. 
- **Route resolution** — intercepts incoming `/BYPWtH2qYos` requests and transparently decodes them back to `1` behind the scenes.

**No traits. No model changes. No config publishing. No DB migrations. Just install.**

## Installation

```bash
composer require arnaldo-tomo/rotabonita
```

**That's it. No further configuration, publishing, or migrating required.** 

Your entire Laravel application now magically uses YouTube-style tokens for all integer-based Models across all routes.

---

## Uninstallation

Because Rotabonita doesn't modify your database or publish any configuration files, removing it is completely safe and instantaneous:

```bash
composer remove arnaldo-tomo/rotabonita
```

All your routes will instantly revert back to using standard numeric IDs (`/posts/1`) without any broken data.

---

## What changes?

**Before** installing Rotabonita:
```
GET  /posts/1
GET  /posts/2
GET  /users/47
```

**After** installing Rotabonita:
```
GET  /posts/BYPWtH2qYos
GET  /posts/K9mXpL2rTnQ
GET  /users/w4RvNcJ8ZoM
```

Your code stays **exactly the same**. Models, routes, controllers, Blade templates — nothing changes.

---

## How it works

Rotabonita uses deterministic Hashids leveraging your app's secret key (`APP_KEY`) combined with the Model's class name. This guarantees:
1. Fast, memory-only O(1) performance (no extra DB queries).
2. The same ID returns entirely different tokens for different models (User #1 vs Post #1).
3. The token decodes predictably back to the same ID.

The package intercepts Laravel implicitly in two places:

**1 — On URL generation**
```php
// Transparently intercepts Laravel's UrlGenerator
route('posts.show', $post); // → /posts/BYPWtH2qYos  (not /posts/1)
```

**2 — On route resolution**
```php
// Transparently intercepts RouteMatched Event before Controller receives it
// Reverts: BYPWtH2qYos → 1
GET /posts/BYPWtH2qYos → Resolves exactly as if the user accessed /posts/1
```

If the record isn't found → HTTP 404, same as default Laravel behaviour.

---

## Your code does not change

```php
// Model — unchanged
class Post extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['title']; // Look, ma! No Traits!
}

// Route — unchanged
Route::resource('posts', PostController::class);

// Controller — unchanged
public function show(Post $post): View
{
    return view('posts.show', compact('post'));
}

// Blade — unchanged, but natively generating the token URL
route('posts.show', $post) // → /posts/BYPWtH2qYos ✅
```

## Token format

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Strategy | Fully Dynamic Hashids |
| Length | 11 characters |
| Alphabet | `A–Z a–z 0–9 _ -` (64 symbols) |
| Entropy source | Uses your `APP_KEY` alongside the model's namespace |
| Edge-case Guard | Silently skips UUIDs & models missing incrementing Keys |

---

## Compatibility
